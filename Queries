At a particular point the intermediate UAT branches for specific tenant 
would give conflicts while merging with UAT

We can have common files in separate/segregated branch.

Incase of scenario3 conflicts can still occur while merging PR from different intermediate branches into UAT2.0.0

Is it feasible to go for tenant specific UAT deployments?

For production deployment as per scenario3 we can 
 1)merge UAT intermediate tenant branch into release


What if we have the to work on further new feature so new branch will be created from UAT2.0.0?
