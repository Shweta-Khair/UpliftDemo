At a particular point the intermediate UAT branches for a specific tenant 
would give conflicts while merging with UAT.

We can have common files in separate/segregated branches.

In the case of scenario3 conflicts can still occur while merging PR from different intermediate branches into UAT2.0.0

Is it feasible to go for tenant-specific UAT deployments?

For production deployment as per scenario 3, we can 
 1)merge UAT intermediate tenant branch into the release


What if we have to work on a further new feature so a new branch will be created from UAT2.0.0?
